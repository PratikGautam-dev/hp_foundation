### Our Story Section

**Heading:** Our Story

**Content:**
```
Hira Prasad Welfare Foundation was founded by Akshita Singh with a vision to uplift the most vulnerable members of our society. Growing up in Samastipur, Bihar, Akshita witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by elderly citizens left without care, children deprived of education, and women struggling for basic opportunities.

What started as a personal calling has grown into a comprehensive welfare organization dedicated to creating lasting social change. Named in honor of values that emphasize service and compassion, our foundation operates on the principle that every individual—regardless of age, gender, or background—deserves to live a dignified and fulfilling life.

Today, we work across Samastipur and neighboring regions, providing integrated support through our three core programs: elderly care, children's welfare, and women's empowerment. Our approach is rooted in respect, personalized attention, and sustainable community development.

### Challenges We Address

**Heading:** The Problems We're Solving

**Challenge 1: Lack of Elderly Care**
```
Many senior citizens in rural areas face neglect and lack proper care, leading to isolation and poor quality of life. Traditional family structures are changing, leaving the elderly without support systems.
```

**Challenge 2: Limited Access to Education**
```
Underprivileged children often lack access to quality education due to financial constraints, inadequate infrastructure, and social barriers, hindering their future opportunities and perpetuating cycles of poverty.
```

**Challenge 3: Health Inequality**
```
Marginalized communities, especially children, suffer from inadequate healthcare services and nutrition. Preventable diseases and malnutrition affect development and quality of life.
```

**Challenge 4: Gender Inequality**
```
Women in rural areas face barriers in education, employment, and social rights. Lack of skills and resources limits their empowerment and independence, affecting entire families.
